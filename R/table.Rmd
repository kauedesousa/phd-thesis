This thesis would hardly be possible without the contribution of a number of people, to be exact, 34 co-authors who contributed in some extent to the construction of this work. I really appreciate that help. One special thanks to Jenny Ordoñez, Maarten van Zonneveld, Milena Holmgren and Leida Mercado who guided me in the first steps that I took towards this project. Your support, advice, encouragement, and brilliant insights are something that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. Thank you!
