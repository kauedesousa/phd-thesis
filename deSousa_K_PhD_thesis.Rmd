# Abstract

Agriculture is a dynamic activity that constantly evolve since its origin. It sustains food and other goods that the global population depends on. Aiming to ensure global food security, the sector has evolved dramatically, especially over the last century with the introduction of high-yielding crops, improved technology, and pathogen resistant and nutrition enriched varieties, to name a few. Still, according to the FAO, the food security issue is constantly present. In 2019, around 26% of the world population experienced either a moderate or severe level of food insecurity. Climate change makes the challenge of food security even more accurate. To cope with climate change and global food insecurity, the whole food system needs to be transformed, including at farm level but also on how food is distributed and what we eat. It is argued that increased agrobiodiversity through farm diversification and varietal selection can help farmers to cope up with the negative effects of climate change while ensuring food security. However, such approaches have been difficult to scale up. One could argue that we often lack information to understand the contexts that drives farmers’ adaptation decisions. In this project we developed methods and tools to support farmers and stakeholders in adapting to a changing climate. We compiled evidence and insights from three continents to improve the understanding of the food systems at the farm level, and specifically for smallholders.

# Introduction

Climate change has increased the risks and uncertainties associated with agriculture [@Challinor2016; @Campbell2016; @Steenwerth2014], which is one of the top sectors contributing to greenhouse gases accumulation [@Poore2018], and one of the most vulnerable to its effects [@Godfray2010; @Tilman2011]. Around the globe, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events are expected [@Aguilar2005; @Imbach2018; @Lin2017; @Zohner2020], but its extent are hard to predict and will vary among regions. In the tropics, unpredictable precipitation and temperature oscillation associated with climate change has increased the concerns for farm adaptation, predominantly comprised by low-input smallholder systems that most likely will experience large yield gaps [@Challinor2016; @Peng2004; @Challinor2014; @Zhao2017]. On the other hand, an increase in temperatures, rainfall, and $CO_2$ levels may increase the productivity of agriculture in certain areas, most likely in some temperate zones [@DaMatta2019; @Tollenaar2017; @King2018]. This is however complicated, as increased pest pressure from weeds, insects and diseases, and highly seasonal climate variations are expected as well [@King2018; @Deutsch2018].

Agriculture, however, is a dynamic activity that have gone through a series of transformations over centuries. In its origins, human populations selected, domesticated and replicated the best plant genotypes and developed intercropping systems on which were the first steps of organised societies [@Bellwood2004; @Maezumi2018; @Zeven1998; @Vavilov1992]. In the last century, in the attempt to provide food for a growing human population, agriculture evolved dramatically through the release of technological packages with high-yielding and high-tolerant crops that boosted agricultural production [@Eshed2019; @Hickey2019]. This revolution led to complex and diversified food systems that improved food access and economic growth throughout the world [@Hickey2019; @Pingali2012]. However, this also produced trade-offs such as land degradation [@Gibbs2010], the increase in the intake of high caloric and poorly nutritional foods [@Pingali2012], and reduction in agricultural diversity through a greater focus on few crop species [@Manners2018]. Also, the question on how to feed a growing human population is still persists [@SOFI2019], despite the great contributions achieved in the agricultural sector [@Pingali2012]. Climate change magnifies the challenge. This calls for a new revolution and transformation of our food systems, including at farm level [@Nelson2020; @Sanchez2020; @Manners2018], but also on how food is distributed and what we eat [@Willett2019; @Hirvonen2020]. 

It is argued that adoption of sustainable intensification and agroecological practices to meet the future challenges will help farmers to cope up with the effects of climate change [@Zimmerer2017; @Nelson2020; @Lipper2014; @Thornton2017; @Campbell2016; @Steenwerth2014; @Andrade2020]. This transformation would involve a number of integrative approaches to help farmers to reorient their agricultural practices to ensure a rise in productivity, farm income and food security while adapting and mitigating to climate change. These practices include a range of actions, such as diversification, agroforestry, varietal selection, crop breeding, and ecosystem management. Diversification, with the use of crop variety management or agroforestry, is one of the most promoted approaches [@vanZonneveld2020]. However, this approach need to be explored to identify local solutions that embrace the complexity of the cropping system with its ecological interactions and abiotic factors. 

For diversification with varietal selection, one proposed solution is to increase variety supply by accelerating crop breeding for more robust varieties and at the same time replace old varieties from the seed system [@Atlin2017]. Supply-driven variety replacement assumes that new varieties are well adapted to local environments and acceptable to farmers. For many climate-vulnerable crops and regions, this assumption is unwarranted. Varieties are often recommended without geographic analysis of climate adaptation to determine recommendation domains [@Annicchiarico2002]. A solution could come from a more scalable type of participatory research that *crowdsources* farmers' local knowledge through citizen science [@vanEtten2019tricot; @Beza2017; @Steinke2017].

In terms of agroforestry, adaptation is addressed by introducing trees to the agricultural production system to ameliorate abiotic stress and facilitate the performance of understory crops [@Blaser2018; @Holmgren1997]. This approach is particularly challenging, as perennial crops take long before farmers fully benefit from their management decisions [@Ramirez2001; @deSousa2016; @Cerda2014]. Two issues also increase the uncertainty of agroforestry to address climate adaptation and risk management. First, climate change may also affect the habitat for agroforestry tree species [@Lyra2017]. Second, interactions between trees and crops could drive negative results in productivity [@Blaser2018; @Abdulai2017], limiting the interest of farmers in adapt to this approach. Understand the effects of climate change on the suitability of agroforestry species may be one approach to support farmers in selecting agroforestry designs at low risk.

These issues highlight the need of rapid, tailored and straightforward solutions to help farmers to deal with climate change. In this thesis I analysed diversification approaches to bring new insights to generate accurate climate-friendly recommendations for farmers across different climatic spaces. I focussed on smallholder farming, which is conducted in more than 570 million farms worldwide [@Lowder2016], contribute to around 30-34% of global food supply [@Ricciardi2018], and are central for the conservation of agrobiodiversity [@Altieri2017]. Smallholder farming is also identified by several authors as the most vulnerable to climate change [@Lipper2014; @Harvey2014; @Vermeulen2012].

# Objectives

In this thesis I focussed on providing insight and developing methods to support farmers and stakeholders in adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate, specifically for smallholders, by answering the following questions:

**1. How does climate awareness influence farmers’ adaptation decisions? (Paper 1)**

Climate change increases the risks and uncertainties associated with agriculture, particularly for smallholders [@Altieri2017; @Campbell2016]. The evidence has shown that the adoption of agricultural innovations and climate-adapted practices can help vulnerable farmers to cope with the effects of climate variability and change [@Lipper2014; @Vermeulen2013; @Vermeulen2012]. These practices include farm sustainable intensification, diversification of production, agroforestry, crop variety management and plant breeding. Farmers' awareness and perceptions of climate change are correlated with the adoption of such innovations [@Elum2017; @Niles2016; @Schattman2016; @Singh2017], but no evidence is provided for smallholders in Central America. Paper 1 [@deSousa2018] targets this knowledge gap. 

**2. What is the future of current agroforestry combinations in coffee and cocoa production systems? (Paper 2)**

Agroforestry, the deliberate and simultaneous management of trees within crop or livestock systems [@Nair1993], is considered an important climate-adapted innovation to increase the resilience of agricultural systems [@Spurgeon1979]. Trees can ameliorate the micro-climate and facilitate the performance of understory crops [@Holmgren2010]. Most perennial crop systems in Central America are managed following agroforestry practices [@Beer1998; @Somarriba2013], and have been increasingly encouraged as climate change is projected to affect future crop production [@OvalleRivera2015]. Nevertheless, climate change can also affect the future ecological niches of several tree species [@Holmgren2013; @Lyra2017] and may hamper the prospects of agroforestry as a viable approach for climate adaptation. Paper 2 [@deSousa2019] assesses the future of the 100 most common tree species found in Arabica coffee (*Coffea arabica* L.) and cocoa (*Theobroma cacao* L.) production systems in Central America.

**3. Can cocoa become a suitable alternative in vulnerable coffee production areas? (Paper 2)**

As climate change projections points to a decline in coffee production due to the increasingly climate variability [@OvalleRivera2015; @Bunn2015; @Laderach2017], farmers have developed an interest for cocoa. The drivers of this shift are trends in recent years of increasing coffee production costs and large loses due to pests and diseases (*e.g.* leaf rust crisis) [@Avelino2015]. Replacing coffee by cocoa has become one of the main strategies for climate change adaptation for producers in low elevation areas [@Laderach2017]. Nevertheless, there is no quantitative assessment of the feasibility of such strategy, starting from considering that cocoa is vulnerable to climate change itself [@Schroth2016]. Paper 2 [@deSousa2019] also explores this strategy assessing the potential areas where cocoa is a suitable alternative to coffee.


**4. Can on-farm participatory crop trials generate insights into variety management for climate adaptation? (Paper 3)**

Crop improvement increases production and contribute the food and nutrition security [@Hickey2019; @Godfray2010]. Previous studies have shown that is critical that farmers keep a continuous turnover of improved and local-adapted varieties for climate adaptation [@Challinor2016; @Atlin2017]. One constraint, however, in adopting this practice is the cost in investing in seasonal management. Farmers often rely on their local varieties and changing to new ones can increase the risks when the performance of these varieties under local conditions is unknown [@Dawson2008]. Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack the ability to provide such recommendations in marginal production environments across space and time. Paper III [@vanEtten2019] address this issue by exploring a participatory approach to characterise varietal climatic responses allowing for seasonal and geographical extrapolation. 

**5. Can a data-driven decentralised approach improve the selection of genotypes in challenging crop production environments? (Paper IV)**

To adapt to climate change farmers require accelerated selection of genotypes and production of local-adapted varieties [@Godfray2010; @Eshed2019]. Conventional breeding programs have proven high success in maximizing genetic diversity in the early stages of selection and then identifying superior germplasm [@Hickey2019]. At present, plant breeders use genomic-driven approaches to increase selection intensity while reducing the time of the breeding cycle and deriving greater genetic gain. However, the same approach does not translate well in marginal environments characterised by a diversity of environments and management practices [@Annicchiarico2019]. Decentralised participatory approaches could help breeders in accelerate the selection of genotypes while addressing the $G \times E \times M$ interactions (genotype by environment by management) required for challenging crop production environments [@Ceccarelli2019; @vanEeuwijk2001; @Tester2010; @vanEtten2019tricot; @Annicchiarico2019]. Paper IV [@deSousa2020] addresses this issue by proposing a decentralised data-driven approach scaled by citizen science.

**6. Can we develop tools to allow the analyses of this theses to be piped into a reproducible and replicable workflow? (Paper IV)**

# Methods

## Research sites

The studies took place in three different regions, Central America, East Africa and South Asia (Fig. 1). The regions are characterised by its rich plant diversity being *Centre of Origin* and domestication [@Vavilov1992] of important staples and crops such as common beans (*Phaseolus vulgaris* L.), durum wheat (*Triticum durum* Desf.), maize (*Zea mays* L.), rice (*Oryza sativa* L.), bread wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.), coffee and cocoa. Smallholder agriculture and livestock production are the main livelihood for the majority of the population. Poverty and food insecurity levels are still among the higher in the world. According to the 2019's report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition [@SOFI2019], in 2018 Central America, East Africa and South Asia, respectively, had a prevalence of severe or moderate food insecurity for 31.5%, 62.7% and 34.3% of their total population.

knitr::include_graphics("display-items/research_sites.png")
```

Field data was collected between 2010 and 2016 as part of several Research for Development programs performed across the regions. In Central America, farmer's surveys were conducted in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. A subset of participatory crop trials was conducted in Nicaragua. Sampled farmers extended across three ecological regions, the Central American Atlantic Moist Forests, the Central American Dry Forests and the Central American Pine-Oak Forests. Important crops grown by smallholders in the region are maize, common bean, sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor* (L.) Moench), banana (*Musa* spp.), coffee and cocoa, the last two grown for the international markets, while the others for local markets and household consumption. 

In East Africa, the research was conducted in the regions of Amhara, Oromia and Tigray in Ethiopia, which encompasses one main ecological region, the Ethiopian Montane Grasslands and Woodlands. The main crop grown by smallholder farmers in this region are durum wheat, teff (*Eragrostis tef* (Zucc.) Trotter), barley (*Hordeum vulgare* L.) and sorghum, mostly for household consumption and local markets. In South Asia, the research was conducted across the States of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in India encompassing three ecological regions, the Upper Gangetic Plains Moist Deciduous Forests, the Lower Gangetic Plains Moist Deciduous Forests, and the Narmada Valley Dry Deciduous Forests. The main crop grown by smallholders are rice, bread wheat, maize, and several pulses and vegetables. Table 1 presents a description on the environmental characteristics of each region extracted from the sampled locations used in this research [@Hijmans2005; @srtm; @Olson2001].

## Farmers' climate awareness and adaptation strategies

This part of the research was performed only in Central America. In 2014, we performed a survey to 283 households participating in the Mesoamerican Environmental Program (MAP) [@Gutierrez2020]. Farmers were questioned about their perceptions regarding changes in precipitation and temperature over the 10 years before the interviews (2005–2014). Farmers who reported to have felt changes in climatic patterns were asked to list the farm management practices they have adopted in their crop systems to cope with such changes. These practices were ranked by the order they were mentioned. We wanted to answer two main questions, how accurate are the farmers' perceptions to climate change with observed time series data, and whether socio-economic factors can influence farmers' adaptation decisions. 

To address the first question, we linked the farmers responses as categorical variables (*e.g.* more precipitation, less precipitation, uncertain rain season) to a gridded time series precipitation database from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset [@Funk2015]. This dataset incorporates global daily rainfall from 1983 to near-present with a resolution of 2.5 arc-min, which is obtained by weather stations and combined with remote sensing. Changes in precipitation were assessed by calculating three extreme precipitation indices using an alpha version of the R [@RCoreTeam] package `climatrends` [@climatrends]. For this analysis we used the simple daily intensity index (SDII, total precipitation/rainy days), the maximum 5-day precipitation (Rx5day), and the maximum length of consecutive dry days (MLDS). We linked the observed changes in precipitation and farmers’ perceptions with a multiple correspondence analysis using the R package `FactoMineR` [@Le2008].

The second question was answered by linking the farmers prioritised adaptation management strategies with their socio-economic data. Household socio-economic data was obtained by the baseline survey performed with all farmers for the Mesoamerican Environmental Program. From the adaptation strategies derived from all responses, we compiled a list of 10 options: (*i*) Change in Agricultural Calendar, (*ii*) Change in Varieties, (*iii*) Production Diversification, (*iv*) Introduction of New Crops, (*v*) Less Fertilizers and Pesticides, (*vi*) Reforestation and Restoration, (*vii*) Sustainable Soil Management, (*viii*) Sustainable Water Management, (*ix*) Leave Farming System, and (*x*) More Fertilizers and Pesticides. 

The relative importance of the different strategies was measured using the Bradley-Terry (BT) model [@Bradley1952], which estimates the *worth* parameter (relative importance) in pairwise comparisons which can be described using the following equation. 

Equation [1]

$$P (i \succ j) = \frac{p_i}{p_i + p_j}$$

where $p_i$ is a positive real-valued score assigned to individual $i$. The comparison $i \succ j$ can be read as "$i$ is preferred over $j$"

We used the top 5 strategies mentioned by each interviewed farmer and converted it into pairwise comparisons using an alpha version of the R package `gosset` [@gosset]. Socio-economic variables were linked to the pairwise rankings using the Model-Based Recursive Partitioning approach [@Zeileis2008] implemented in R by the package `psychotree` [@Strobl2011]. The algorithm starts by fitting a BT model to the full data, then it assesses the stability of the *worth* parameters, if there is a significant instability, the full data is split by the covariate with strong instability. The process is repeated until there is no more significant instability [@Zeileis2008]. We linked six covariates: (*i*) the ecoregion (Dry or Rainforest), (*ii*) the Progress Out of Poverty Index (PPI), (*iii*) the literacy level of the head of household, (*iv*) the area of the main crop system (ha), (*v*) the age of the head of household, and (*vi*) the number of practices adopted by the farmers after participating in the Farmers Field Schools led by MAP.


## Mapping future suitability of coffee and cocoa agroforestry

This assessment focussed on Central America within the coordinates 101 to 77 E and 7 to 22 N. We wanted to answer two main questions, how ecologically resilient are the trees commonly used by farmers in coffee and cocoa agroforestry systems, and whether cocoa can be a suitable alternative for coffee growers. These questions came out as a result from the assessment on farmers' adaptation decisions described in the earlier section. Among the 10 adaptation decisions mentioned by the interviewed farmers, restoration and reforestation (using agroforestry) were the most preferred [@deSousa2018]. 

To answer the first question, we assessed the current and future potential distribution of the top-100 commonly used tree species in cocoa and coffee plantations across Central America. The selection of the 100 species was based on three criteria. The first was the abundance reported in relevant datasets of agroforestry inventories conducted in smallholder farms across the region [@Bonilla2014; @Orozco2014; @Sepulveda2016], selecting from the most abundant to the least. We then filtered the list of species based on ecological and economic services identified by farmers and reported in the literature [@CATIE2003], taxa were classified by their main use; N-fixing, timber or fruit. The last criterion was the availability of at least 60 geographical records to ensure accurate modelling results. To answer the second, question we compared the current potential areas for coffee and cocoa production with their projected distribution under climate change scenarios. 

Bioclimatic predictors from WorldClim v1.4 [@Hijmans2005] were used to model the current distribution of the 100 species, coffee and cocoa. These bioclimatic variables are widely used in ecology to model the distribution of species based on their interaction with the variation in precipitation and temperature [@Booth2018]. To avoid model overfitting, we selected the least correlated variables based the variance inflation factors, retaining those with VIF < 10 [@Ranjitkar2014]. This resulted in nine bioclimatic variables. Future projections were based on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios of climate change [@vanVuuren2011], RCP4.5 as an intermediate scenario and RCP8.5 as a high emissions scenario. We used future bioclimatic variables downscaled from 17 General Circulation Models that were available for both RCP scenarios. 

The distribution of the 100 species and coffee and cocoa was modelled using an ensemble suitability method implemented by the R package `BiodiversityR` [@Kindt2018]. The procedure consists of four steps that, first, calibrate the model by assessing the performance of 18 algorithms of species distribution models (SDM) measured with the area under the curve (AUC). In this step, the AUC values obtained by each algorithm are weighed using the following equation: 

Equation [2]

$$S_e = \frac{\sum_i w_i S_i}{\sum_i w_i}$$

where the ensemble suitability ($S_e$) is obtained as a weighted ($w$) average of suitabilities predicted by the contributing algorithm ($S_i$).

The second step consists in retaining only the algorithms that contributed at least in 5$\%$ to the ensemble suitability ($S_e$). The third step generates the suitability maps using the predictions from the algorithms that were selected in the second step. Finally, to generate the presence–absence layers, we convert the consensus suitability from the third step using the threshold of maximum specificity $+$ maximum sensitivity [@Liu2013]. Replication data and code used in this analysis are available through Dataverse [@deSousa2018data].

## Evaluation of crop varieties

This part of the research was performed between 2012 and 2016 during three growing seasons in Ethiopia, five growing seasons in Nicaragua, and four growing seasons in India (Table 2). Three crops were evaluated, common beans in Nicaragua, durum wheat in Ethiopia and bread wheat in India. The question that we addressed was whether on-farm participatory crop trials, scaled through a citizen science approach, can provide robust, actionable information on varietal climate adaptation. This aimed to respond to one open question in the assessment of farmers' adaptation decisions where change in crop varieties (or crop variety management) showed to be one of the least choices in adaptation decisions among the farmers.

We compiled data from 12,409 farmer-managed plots across the research sites. Trial design followed the *tricot* approach, standing for triadic comparison of technologies [@vanEtten2019tricot]. The approach follows five principles:  (*i*) anonymous subsets of three varieties (out of a larger set) are allocated randomly as incomplete blocks [@Atlin2001]; (*ii*) participants receive one subset to grow in their farms under their own management practices (Figure 2); (*iii*) plots are set up within the crop system, plots are small to facilitate participation but large enough to avoid strong edge effects; (*iv*) participants indicate the relative performance of varieties through ranking answering to two short statements for each targeted characteristic (*e.g.* which variety had the best leaf development? which variety had worst leaf development?); (*v*) data from each farmer-managed plot is collated into a single dataset.

```{r nplots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis", warning = FALSE}
tb <- as.data.frame(matrix(
  c("2012","–","562","–","–","–",
    "2013","176","4,134","–","–","–",
    "2014","578","4,947","–","–","–",
    "2015","336","834","–","481","177",
    "2016","–","–","64","87","33"),
  nrow = 5, ncol = 6, byrow = TRUE
))

names(tb) <- c("Research Site", "Ethiopia", "India", "Primera", "Apante", "Postrera")

kable(tb,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      align = "lccccc",
      caption = "Number of tricot trials per cropping season of durum wheat (Ethiopia, Meher season), bread wheat (India, Rabi season), and common beans (Nicaragua).") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 3, "Nicaragua" = 3)) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position",
                position = "center",
                font_size = 9)

# kable(tb,
#       caption = "Table 2. Number of tricot trials per cropping season of durum wheat (Ethiopia, Meher season), bread wheat (India, Rabi season),
#       and common beans (Nicaragua).",
#              row.names = FALSE)
```

For the analysis of the ranking data generated by farmers, we used the Plackett–Luce (PL) model [@Luce1959; @Plackett1975], implemented in R with the package `PlackettLuce` [@Turner2020]. The PL model is similar to the Bradley-Terry model above. Whereas the BT model is used for pairwise comparisons, the PL model is used for rankings of three or more items. PL model determines the values of positive-valued parameters $\alpha_i$ (*worth*) associated with each variety $i$. These parameters $\alpha$ are related to the probability ($P$) that item $i$ wins against all other $n$ items in the following way:

Equation [3]

$$P(i \succ \{j, ..., n\}) = \frac{a_i}{a_1 + ... + a_n}$$

\

Climatic variables were linked to the rankings using the Model-Based Recursive Partitioning approach [@Zeileis2008] which builds the Plackett-Luce trees. This process is explained in the previous section on farmers' adaptation decisions. For the climatic variables, we used free publicly available datasets with coverage across all the research sites to make comparable studies. We derived rainfall and temperature indices using an alpha version of the R package `climatrends` [@climatrends]. Rainfall was obtained using the CHIRPS dataset [@Funk2015], while temperature was obtained from MODIS MYD11A2 [@Wan2015]. The MODIS data was provided in its raw format, to reduce noise and fill gaps, we used the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter with a window size of 12 for the polynomial smoothing [@Chen2004].

Fourteen climatic variables were extracted for the vegetative, reproductive and grain filling period and the whole growth period (from planting date to harvesting) in each observation point. This resulted in 110 variables. To create models that provide generalizable predictions across seasons, we used blocked cross-validation (with seasons as blocks) combined with a forward variable selection procedure [@Meyer2018]. We used the deviance values of each validation season to calculate an Akaike weight, which is the probability that a given variable combination represents the best model [@Wagenmakers2004]. We performed forward variable selection, using this combined Akaike weight as our selection criterion. From each study case (country) this procedure retained one variable, which were the maximum night temperature ($^\circ$C) during the vegetative and reproductive periods for common beans in Nicaragua, the minimum night temperature ($^\circ$C) during the vegetative period for durum wheat in Ethiopia, and the diurnal temperature range ($^\circ$C) during the vegetative period for bread wheat in India.

We compared the goodness-of-fit of the model with climatic variables (climate model) against three other models. The first with no covariates (intercept-only model), the second with geolocation, season, planting dates, and soil categories, which represented the experimental design (design model). And the third model with a combination of climatic variables plus geolocation (climate + geolocation model). To compare the models, we calculated a weighted average of pseudo-$R^2$ (deviance reduction) values across testing seasons [@Agresti2002], using the square root of the sample size as weights [@Whitlock2005]. All this process was done using an alpha version of the R package `gosset` [@gosset]. Replication data and code used in this analysis are available through Dataverse [@vanettenreplic]

## Decentralised genotype selection

This research was performed in Ethiopia from 2012 to 2015 with durum wheat. The main question that we addressed was whether a decentralised approach could improve the selection of genotypes for crop breeding targeting challenging crop production environments. We compared a *data-driven decentralised breeding* approach, or 3D-breeding, for short, with a benchmark representing a centralised approach used in current breeding programs (Figure 3). A total of 400 durum wheat genotypes were selected from a representative collection of accessions from the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute. 

Centralised trials were performed in 2012 and 2013 in the districts of Geregera (Amhara) and Hagreselam (Tigray). In 2012, thirty experienced smallholder farmers (15 men and 15 women) were invited to participate in the trial evaluations at the station plots, held concurrently after flowering stage. The farmers had no previous knowledge of the genotypes included in this study to prevent bias in the evaluations. The participants provided appraisal with Likert scales (1 to 5 worse to best) [@Likert1932] given to genotypes for overall appreciation (OA) [@Mancini2017; @Kidane2017]. Research technicians measured grain yield (GY) as grams of grain produced per plot, then converted into $t \cdot ha^{-1}$. Absolute values of GY and OA measured in centralised trials were converted into ordinal rankings.

A total of 1,165 decentralised plots were performed between 2013 and 2015 during three cropping seasons across the regions of Amhara (471), Oromia (399) and Tigray (295) using a subset of the 41 best genotypes identified through farmer evaluation in centralised trials [@Mancini2017]. Season 1 (2013) comprised 179 fields, Season 2 (2014) comprised 651 fields, and Season 3 (2015) comprised 335 field. Trial design followed the *tricot* approach as described in the previous section. Farmers reported the overall appreciation and research technicians collected GY measures in farmers' plots after harvesting. The comparison 3D-breeding vs bechmark was done using the subset of 41 genotypes used in both trials.

Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves pooled from five seedlings for each of the accessions in the centralised trials with the GenEluteTM Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions in the Molecular and Biotechnology Laboratory at Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Genotyping was performed on the Infinium 90k wheat chip at TraitGenetics GmbH (Gatersleben, Germany). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using the tetraploid wheat pipeline in GenomeStudio V11 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Full details on the genotyping are given by Mengistu et al. [-@Mengistu2016].

We derived best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values from GY and OA measured in centralised trials. The benchmark representing a centralised breeding system was conducted using genomic selection models and marker-based genetic relationship matrices computed on BLUP data. To measure accuracy of genomic selection predictions, we calculated the Kendall’s tau coefficient ($\tau$), a measure of similarity of rankings [@Kendall1938], between predicted values and observed values.

```

The statistical model that represented 3D-breeding was developed using the data generated by the citizen science decentralised trials using the Plackett-Luce model. DNA data from SNPs was added into the model as a prior using an additive matrix. To take into account explanatory variables, we created Plackett-Luce trees through Model-Based Recursive Partitioning. Daily temperature and precipitation data was obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center Surface meteorological and Solar Energy (SSE) web portal supported by the NASA LaRC POWER Project (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/), using the R package `nasapower` [@Sparks2018]. Climatic variables were obtained using the R package `climatrends` [@climatrends]. We selected the most relevant climatic variable using the process described in the earlier section. Which retained the maximum night temperature ($^\circ$C) during reproductive growth and the minimum night temperature ($^\circ$C) during the vegetative growth. Replication data and code used in this analysis are available through Dataverse [@deSousa2020data].

# Results and discussion

## Farmers' adaptation decisions

In Central America, 255 farmers (out of 283) reported to perceived changes in climate patterns over the 10 years prior to the survey (2005–2014). The multiple correspondence analysis of farmers’ perceptions versus anomalies from observed data shows partial correlations between farmers’ perceptions and the time series data (Figure 4). Farmers who perceived an uncertainty on the start/end of the rainy season correlate with observed decrease in heavy precipitation (Rx5day) and an increase of the duration of consecutive dry days (MLDS). Farmers who perceived less annual precipitation correlate with observed increase in heavy precipitation. Those who perceived more precipitation or heavy precipitation did not correlate with any of the observed precipitation indices.

The partial correlations in observed and perceived climate may be explained by the difficulty to properly observe the changes, as they occur, without the aid of measuring devices (*e.g.* weather station, garden moisture meter), absence of climate services [@Bouroncle2019] or cognitive bias [@Holmgren2018bias]. However, even if farmers do not perfectly perceive these changes in climate patterns, they do observe reductions in their yields and at times losses of their crops, which draws their attention to climate-related issues and increases their willingness to innovate and try new farm management practices. Previous studies reported this behaviour as a product of experiencing climatic risks or disasters [@Bergquist2019; @vanValkengoed2019].

In the case of interviewed farmers in Central America, there was a list of 10 practices that were adapted upon the perception of changes in climate patterns. The *worth* parameters for the adaptation practices show significant differences between the ranked options (Table 3). Practices of *Reforestation and Restoration*, *Introduction of New Crops*, and *Sustainable Soil Management* were reported as the most preferred choices among interviewed farmers, showing higher *worth* than the reference *Production Diversification*, which is one of the most recommended adaptation strategy for farmers in seasonal crop systems [@Atlin2017; @vanZonneveld2020]. *Change in varieties*, had a lower *worth* than the reference. The other practices were ranked below the reference, with *Leave Farming System* and *Change Agricultural Calendar* on the bottom of preferred practices to adapt to perceived changes in climatic patterns.

knitr::include_graphics("display-items/perception_vs_observed.png")
```

We found significant differences in preferences for adaptation practices based on formal education level, farm size and ecological region, whit the Bradley-Terry model identifying four different sub-groups. Overall, reforestation was the preferred choice among farmers independent of socio-economic profiles. This practice had an interplay with agroforestry, where farmers intentionally planted trees or allowed then to grow through natural regeneration within their crop systems. Several studies have reported agroforestry among the bests climate change adaptation strategies [@Mbow2014a; @Mbow2014b; @Verchot2007; @Blaser2018; @Lipper2014], it includes both mitigation and adaptation by providing carbon sink, microclimate regulation and protection to extreme climate events [@Caudill2015; @Holmgren2010; @Torres2017]. Farmers, however, have a clear preference to few marketable species or that has a clear utility within the crop system [@Ordonez2014; @Cerdan2012; @deSousa2016]. Some studies have shown that climate change can also affect the suitability of tree species [@Lyra2017; @deSousa2017Atlas] and hinder the benefits of agroforestry as an adaptation strategy.

Change in varieties was the least choice in the top-5 options reported by farmers in Central America. The low uptake of this approach reflects the weakness of formal and informal seed systems in supporting smallholders to select the right variety [@McGuire2016], mainly the informal seed systems, as it is expected to provide higher contribution for local adaptation [@Bellon2001]. Costs and the high risk associated with crop variety managements by smallholder farmers are also among the reasons for the low uptake. Several studies in Africa and Asia investigated the reason for uptake (or non-uptake) of agricultural innovations among smallholder farmers [@Singh2017; @Elum2017; @Meijer2015; @Senyolo2018], the lack of knowledge [@Meijer2015] and high costs [@Senyolo2018], among other things, were also pointed out as main reasons for non-uptake of innovations, such as crop variety management. Smallholder farming also have an intrinsic characteristic of being performed in diverse low-input systems [@Lowder2016], which makes the challenge of recommending (or producing new) crop varieties more problematic and riskier.

Cost is a factor the involves multiple factors beyond farmers' control and cannot being reduced so easily [@Chapagain2020]. However, risks in selecting crop varieties could be reduced with tailored advice. Recent experiences in Central America, Africa and Asia provided new evidence that this challenge can be addressed by scaling agricultural experimentation with citizen science [@vanEtten2019tricot; @Beza2017; @Steinke2017]. These studies showed positive prospects that citizen science could support seed systems in tracking the responses of crop systems to the changing climate patterns as they occur in the farm and take the best decision towards climate adaptation. The sub-section "Crop variety management" shows the insights that I provided in extending the knowledge about this approach.

Overall, when facing changes in climate, farmers decided to adopt a set of sustainable climate-friendly practices to cope with the negative effects of climate change. The utilisation of more fertilizers and pesticides may be a controversial choice but is likely to be associated with sustainable farm intensification, which helps smallholders in increase productivity [@Cassman1999] while reducing the need to expand the production to new crop areas. The adoption of sustainable practices is likely to be associated with the participation in long-term outreach projects which supports farmers in enhancing their learning about the landscape [@Baumann2020] and led farmers' decisions towards sustainable adaptation decisions [@Gutierrez2015].

## The future of coffee and cocoa agroforestry

Coffee and cocoa are perennial crops with high vulnerability to climate variability. At first, we looked for the future suitability of coffee and cocoa across Central America. The results showed that, by 2050, between 55–62% of current areas for coffee production will likely become unsuitable (Fig. 5A), especially in mid-altitudinal areas (400–700 m a.s.l.). Highlands (>1,800 m a.s.l.) may partly compensate these losses, where coffee will likely expand up to 9–13%. This result confirms the findings of previous studies on Arabica coffee vulnerability [@Bunn2015; @OvalleRivera2015]. 

```{r suitability_coffee_cocoa, fig.cap = "Shifts in suitability due to climate change by 2050 across the altitudinal gradient of (A) coffee (\\emph{Coffea arabica} L.) and (B) cocoa (\\emph{Theobroma cacao} L.) in Central America", echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("display-items/change_suitability.png")
```


In contrast, cocoa is likely to lose between 13–17% of the current distribution range (Fig. 5B) especially in dry lowland areas (0–300 m a.s.l.), expected to become drier in the next decades [@Lyra2017]. Humid areas along the Atlantic coast will remain suitable for cocoa, and have an overlap with a portion of vulnerable coffee areas, showing that cocoa could potentially replace 85% of the vulnerable coffee areas (Fig. 6). 

```{r cocoa_replace, fig.cap = "Potential areas where cocoa (\\emph{Theobroma cacao} L.) could replace coffee (\\emph{Coffea arabica} L.) under climate change.", echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("display-items/cocoa_replace_coffee.png")
```

Even as a current trend [@Renteria2016; @Cohen2016; @Gross2014], changing coffee with cocoa is a dramatic alternative for most smallholder farmers in the region. It requires a series of well-structured efforts to reduce the costs of transformation (maybe subsidised by the cocoa industry) and ensure that farmers are well trained to deliver a product that meets the strict market requirements [@Levai2015], to name a few. Additionally, a recent study showed that the impacts of climate change on coffee could be lower than what was projected [@DaMatta2019]. For example, coffee could find optimal growth conditions with the increase of $CO_2$ availability, new varieties with local adaptation are in the breeding pipeline [@Arguedas2019; @Pruvot2020; @Marie2020], and technological changes could sustain coffee production in the future. Is important to note that projections based on ecological niches, as the object of our study, do not take into account site-specific agroecological factors, and should be used as a proxy to identify vulnerable areas and define adaptation strategies, like those discussed by DaMatta et al. [-@DaMatta2019]. 

Alternatively, by managing agroforestry systems, farmers could potentially maintain their current coffee and cocoa plantations using suitable trees to ameliorate microclimatic conditions. This alternative could also prevent the expansion of agricultural activities towards protected areas that are reported to be suitable in the future [@Schroth2015]. Although it may require a change in the current agroforestry combinations given our projections showing a high vulnerability of the most preferred tree species (Fig. 7). 


Looking at specific tree groups by their main use, we estimate that 20 of the 33 fruit trees will lose more than 15% of their current suitability in coffee areas. The same trend is observed for 14 fruit trees in cocoa suitable areas. High losses (>15%) are expected for 25 of the 30 N-fixing tree species assessed in coffee and for 18 N-fixing tree species in cocoa areas. We also estimate loses of >15% for 22 of 37 species in coffee and 12 tree species in cocoa areas. Most of these losses accounts for the most preferred tree species, such as the timber species cedar (*Cedrela odorata* L.), the fruit species avocado (*Persea americana* Mill.), and the N-fixing poró (*Erythrina poeppigiana* (Walp.) O.F.Cook).

Despite the overall losses in suitability for some of the most popular tree species, our projections suggest that agroforestry could persist as a viable alternative to manage coffee and cocoa plantations in Central America. Approximately 72% of coffee areas (both, remaining and vulnerable) will be suitable for more than 30 tree species. This includes a portfolio of at least 10 species per main use (10 fruit species, 10 N-fixing species and 10 timber species). Most of these tree species are already present in coffee plantations (as identified in the baseline inventories) but mainly in low densities and remain underutilised. Only 9% of coffee areas have very low tree species options (<3 species). The results also suggest that cocoa suitable areas have a higher potential for agroforestry than coffee, with 95% of cocoa areas being suitable for more than 30 tree species. Only 3% of cocoa areas have very low tree species options (<3 species) potentially available

```


Coffee areas with high potential to select tree species from a portfolio of at least 10 species per main use include the highlands across the Pine-Oak Forests and Petén-Veracruz Moist Forests in Mexico. In Honduras, the Pine-Oak Forests and Mountain Forests, and across the Talamancan Montane Forests in Costa Rica. Areas with high vulnerability (<3 species per main use) are identified across the midlands Pine-Oak Forests and Dry Forests of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and highlands in Mexico.

Cocoa areas with high potential for selecting trees from a portfolio of more than 30 species (10 per main use) cover all the humid tropical forest at lowlands across the Pacific coast in Costa Rica, Atlantic coast in Nicaragua, Mosquitia in Honduras, Belize, lowlands north of Cobán and south of Sierra Madre in Guatemala and lowlands in the Gulf of Mexico. There is also a high potential for selecting more than 30 species across the transition zones of the Central American Moist Forests and Central American dry forests in Nicaragua, the Dry Forests of El Salvador and the Moist Forests of Costa Rica. Vulnerable cocoa areas with low agroforestry options (< 3 species), are identified across the Dry Forest of Honduras.

The results of our study show that is highly probable that current agroforestry schemes will need to be modified in terms of species composition, since some of the most popular tree species are also vulnerable to future climates. It is particularly concerning the losses in habitat suitability of N-fixing trees since these species make up the most abundant agroforestry trees in coffee and cocoa plantations in the region [@Peeters2003; @Cannavo2011] and have a key role for the management of soil fertility, especially in low-input and smallholder farms [@Schnabel2017].

Rethinking current agroforestry species composition in coffee and cocoa landscapes requires the identification of the best tree species. We found an opportunity for the underutilised species which are present in low densities in coffee and cocoa plantations, and most of them are remnants of previous vegetation [@Ordonez2014]. Expanding the adoption of underutilised species in agroforestry systems will require a deeper understanding of their agronomic performance considering other factors beyond just climate (*e.g.* pest, diseases, soil fertility), crop $\times$ tree interactions, farmers’ perceptions and local knowledge regarding management and utilisation of these tree species, as well as market incentives to facilitate their wider use. Therefore, selecting the best climate-adapted agroforestry designs is one of the big challenges for the future of cocoa and coffee agroforestry. 

Some authors argued that agroforestry (in the case of cocoa) could be less resilient to extreme climates than under full sun [@Abdulai2017], and despite the obvious controversies in the study [@Norgrove2018], the main message is that a bad agroforestry design may hamper known benefits of agroforestry [@Andres2018; @Blaser2018; @Schnabel2017]. The work of Padovan et al. [-@Padovan2015; -@Padovan2018] studying root interactions and water utilisation in coffee agroforestry in a dry region of Nicaragua brought light to our understanding on the crop $\times$ tree interactions that are mostly unknown. Agroforestry is an ancient agricultural practice [@Levis2017; @Maezumi2018; @Nair1993], but also a new discipline with its first concepts being developed in the late 1970's [@Spurgeon1979; @Nair1993], and there is still a number of questions to be explored. More recently, for example, Sauvadet et al. [-@Sauvadet2020] used an approach with phylogenetic analyses that may help in selecting the most appropriate shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems. The utilisation of the functional diversity approach [@Diaz2016; @Suarez2018] linked to farmers knowledge [@Cerdan2012], can also answer a series of open questions on how shade trees interact with crops (during their different phenological stages) and how to best design climate-adapted agroforestry systems.

Overall, the results of our study are just a starting point to develop lines of research that support the re-design of agroforestry schemes and open new venues of research to adapt coffee and cocoa production systems in Central America.

## Crop variety management

We then looked on how to define adaptation strategies in seasonal crops. First we tested whether the model with climatic variables was able to outperform the other three models tested with the farmer-generated rankings. The three case studies provided independent confirmation of the predictive value of the *tricot* trials (Table 4), the model with only climate covariates has the best fit in all cases. Various factors influenced model fit, including farmers’ observation skills and environmental variation. We found that most of the differences were among countries, likely due to the different levels of diversity with the sets of varieties. In Ethiopia, farmers evaluated a large poll of varieties with easily observable differences in performance, while in Nicaragua and India, farmers evaluated a small set of varieties with relatively homogeneous performance.

The results demonstrated the ability of the model with climatic covariates to capture the environmental variability of the sampled environments. This means that the climatic covariates contain unique and substantial information explaining varietal performance. For Nicaragua, we found that common bean variety performance changed when the maximum night temperature exceeded 18.7 $^\circ C$. For durum wheat in Ethiopia, varietal performance were related to cold night temperatures during the vegetative period, threshold of 8.4 $^\circ C$. For bread wheat in India, varietal performance patterns changed with the diurnal temperature range (DTR) during the vegetative period, which is the difference between minimum and maximum daily temperatures, under two thresholds 14.5 $^\circ C$ and 15.7 $^\circ C$. These findings correspond to the threshold temperature for heat stress or cold acclimatisation reported in the literature for each crop species [@Rainey2005; @Fowler2008; @Rao2015].

We showed that the climatic analysis can improve variety recommendations by incorporating seasonal forecasts, and generate variety recommendations for wider areas trough spatial extrapolation (Fig. 8 A, B, C). For Nicaragua we show that official variety recommendations fail to identify superior bean varieties that are sufficiently heat tolerant for the study area. In Ethiopia, the findings can improve variety recommendations for durum wheat by uncovering the importance of cold adaptation. In India, the analysis of the *tricot* trial data adds geographic specificity to the existing variety recommendations and suggests that a broader set of bread wheat varieties should be promoted to take into account the climatic differences across the study area. We quantified how much farmers could benefit from the variety recommendations by calculating variety reliability, the probability of outperforming a check variety. For each location, we compared the recommendations produced in the study with the previous recommendations as the check. Reliabilities ranged from 0.59 to 0.65 in Ethiopia, from 0.58 to 0.60 in Nicaragua, and from 0.51 to 0.62 in India (Fig. 8 D, E, F), indicating substantial benefits for large areas.

```

Overall, the *tricot* citizen science data revealed generalisable relations between seasonal climate variables and crop variety performance that corresponded to known yield-determining factors [@Villegas2016; @Challinor2014]. By scaling the agricultural experimentation we were able to track climate trends as they manifest themselves on farms, adjust variety recommendations and recommendation domains, and contribute to understanding how climate affects on-farm varietal performance. The main contribution is that the citizen science data can be linked to seasonal forecasts to provide tailored crop variety recommendations to smallholder farmers in challenging crop production environments. Other opportunities of this approach for climate adaptation have been discussed elsewhere, arguing that it can be used in agroecological intensification [@Nelson2020], can enhance farmers' access to high-quality germplasm [@vanZonneveld2020], can enhance the accuracy of self-reported data in remote sensing [@Paliwal2020], and can become part of decentralised plant breeding strategies for climate adaptation [@RamirezVillegas2020]. I discuss the later opportunity in the next section.


## Genotype selection in challenging crop environments

We explored the opportunity of the *tricot* approach in support decentralised breeding strategies for climate adaptation. We focussed on the durum wheat trials in Ethiopia, linking the farmer-generated data in the *tricot* trials with environmental and DNA data to track $G \times E \times M$ interactions that could support the selection of local-adapted genotypes for crop breeding. We call this approach *data-driven decentralised breeding*, or 3D-breeding. We established a benchmark that represents a centralised breeding approach that is a competitive alternative to 3D-breeding. We focused on grain yield (GY) and farmers’ overall appreciation of genotypes (OA), which were both recorded in centralised (station) and decentralised (farm) trials. 

The results show that 3D-breeding consistently provided higher accuracy than the benchmark for both GY and OA, and also that OA in 3D-breeding produces higher accuracies than GY (Table 1). Previous studies showed that farmer evaluations are able to capture agronomic performance of genotypes in untested locations [@Kidane2017; @Annicchiarico2019]. Farmers provided OA according to their own experience and preferences, and it presumably depended on a combination of traits of which GY represented only one dimension [@Mancini2017].

We show that 3D-breeding can identify genotypes with local adaptation traits. The best three genotypes in each terminal node of the 3D-breeding model (from the Plackett-Luce trees) had a genetic background markedly separated from that of varieties currently recommended for the region, and consistently higher *worth* (Fig. 9). Indeed, the model selected genotypes derived from landraces over improved varieties. We estimated the probability that the model recommendation exceeds the current recommendation in terms of OA. In this assessment, predictions from 3D-breeding outperformed the current varietal recommendations in most of the farmers’ fields, with consistently higher probabilities (0.83-0.91), including in marginal areas for which the centralised breeding approach could not provide accurate predictions.

In centralised breeding, the environmental variation of target environments is factored through experimental control or indirectly as an average response across breeding stations as in our benchmark. This makes extrapolation to real farming conditions challenging. The 3D-breeding approach addresses the low correlation between performance in selection environments and production environments, while taking a step forward to fully data-driven breeding and may speed up the turnover of varietal release to address the climate change challenges [@Challinor2016; @Ray2012; @Cai2014]. The expansion of the design with the addition of further testing seasons and local management conditions may allow to highlight drivers of local performance of genotypes beyond temperature [@Kehel2016]. Indeed, as the model grew in complexity (by adding the DNA data), it was able to retain another environmental variable (maximum night temperature during reproductive growth) differently from our previous case study with only climate variables [@vanEtten2019].

The advantages provided by the approach are clear, phenotyping costs would be divided in much smaller packets, supporting the modular expansion of the breeding effort towards new genetic materials or new locations. In return, each generated datapoint would be a better representation of the true farming conditions to which varieties are directed. As farmers are at the centre of the experimental design, varieties deriving from 3D-breeding are more likely to be adopted and suited to local cultivation [@Ceccarelli2012; @Rhoades1982], increasing the effectiveness of breeding efforts. Indeed, we found that farmers’ OA was a better predictor than GY in predicting yield realised both in centralised and decentralised trials (Table 5). However, there are a number of open questions in relation to decentralised crop breeding, including how to best motivate new farmers to participate in the evaluation of materials, how much planting material each farmer needs, the logistics of providing farmers with the genetic material, and how to share benefits deriving from the utilisation of farmers’ knowledge to produce new varieties. 

Overall, we show that the data-driven focus of 3D-breeding enables embracing the complexity of real-world $G \times E \times M$ interactions for the benefit of breeding. Such a multidimensional, collaborative approach calls for best practices in data management and sharing [@Leonelli2017]. 3D-breeding is based on a documented set of methods, from experimental design [@vanEtten2019tricot] to data curation and analysis [@gosset; @Turner2020]. Some of these methods were specifically developed to enable the analysis and inference of the *tricot* data, which I explain in the next section. We show that the crowdsourced citizen science approach associated with open-source digital tools makes it possible for breeders and farmers to apply 3D-breeding in new contexts and crops to complement traditional breeding.

## A workflow to analyse crowdsourced citizen science data

During the implementation of the activities in this project we developed a set of tools and methods to accommodate the *tricot* data into a dynamic workflow in R [@RCoreTeam] that could update the models and provide new insights as the database grows in number of datapoints (Fig. 10). This were our first attempts in moving the *tricot* data analysis into a machine learning framework [@James2013]. The workflow follows the steps: (*A*) Several participants contribute with small tasks, as explained in the *tricot* description, (*B*) Explanatory variables are added (*e.g.* using geographical coordinates and planting dates, or even DNA markers), (*C*) Model selection to find the variables that best explain the data, (*D*) Automated reports can be generated and provide feedback to participants, (*E*) A stable recursive partitioning tree is used for further analysis and inference. 

The ClimMob platform (https://climmob.net/) storages the *tricot* data in the cloud. To start the workflow, we developed `ClimMobTools` [@climmobtools] an application programming interface (API) client that allows the user to fetch their *tricot* data into the R section preserving the original data. This package is designed to work with the ClimMob platform and has no clear application in other domains. 

For the other tools, we focused on generalisation, which means that they can be used in other domains outside the proposed workflow. The package `gosset` [@gosset] provides the methods to analyse the *tricot* and other metadata, from collating data (transforming into rankings) to model selection and visualisation. It supports steps A, C, D and E of the workflow. The cross-validation and forward selection procedure, as well as the Akaike weights, pseudo-$R^2$, Kendal $\tau$, and worst regret computation used in Paper III and Paper IV are implemented in this package. Additionally, it also has visualisation tools that help the explanatory analysis of any rank-based data.

```{r workflow, fig.cap = "Workflow to analyse crowdsourced citizen science data. (A) Several participants contribute with small tasks; all data is combined using rankings. (B) Covariates are linked to the rankings using georeferenced information and planting dates. (C) Selection of the most relevant covariate(s) using forward selection approach. (D) Automated reports can be generated to give feedback to participants in A. (E) A stable tree is used for further analysis and inference.", echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("display-items/workflow.png")
```

During the data discovery for Paper III we tried a number of statistical learning process to analyse the *tricot* data (*e.g.* boosting, bootstrap aggregating, cross-validation, forward selection). We found that the combination of cross-validation + forward selection + Akaike weights was the most reasonable method to work with the data. Afterwards, the scripts used in the analysis were converted into functions in the package `gosset` allowing it to be applied in other research domains using Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce or Generalised Linear Models. 

To link environmental covariates with the rankings (Fig. 10B) we developed the packages `chirps` (Paper V) [@chirps] and `climatrends` (Paper VI) [@climatrends]. The package `chirps` offers an API client for the CHIRPS data [@Funk2015] in R. With the package, users can fetch CHIRPS data into the R section and compute rainfall indices that can be linked to the workflow or used in other research domains. The package `climatrends` supports analysis of trends in climate change, ecological and crop modelling by computing temperature and precipitation indices. It started as a set of R scripts used in Paper I [@deSousa2018] and, as it grew in complexity and demand, it was implemented as a R package. The indices implemented in the package derived from literature showing case studies with applications in a diverse set of areas [@Kehel2016; @Aguilar2005; @Prentice1992; @Challinor2016; @Trnka2014]. The climatic data required to compute such indices can be provided by the user (*e.g.* from data loggers) or alternatively using the R package `nasapower` [@Sparks2018] and `chirps`, further details are given in the dynamic documentation in the packages' website. 

One of the steps to better address smallholder farmer adaptation is the evaluation and learning [@vanZonneveld2020]. In step D, supported by the package `gosset`, we provide the supporting methods to give feedback to participants in the *tricot* experiments, a procedure that is automated in the ClimMob platform [@climmobanalysis]. Overall, these tools are our attempt to provide to the research community a set of open source tools for data analysis, and also to enable the replication of the analysis reported in this thesis. 

# Conclusions

This thesis provided insights to support climate adaptation strategies in agriculture. We identified how smallholder farmers react to changes in climate patterns and which were the main socio-economic drivers for their adaptation decisions. Overall, farmers had a tendency to select sustainable practices which is likely related to their participation and training in long-term research for development programs that were conducted across the research areas. Reforestation and restoration (linked to agroforestry) is the most preferred adaptation decision among the participants in this research. Crop variety management is considered a risk activity and was identified as the least choice in the top-5 adaptation decisions reported by farmers. 

Farmers selected a number of tree species to intercrop in their systems, but had a clear preference towards increasing tree density using a small set of species. Based on the modelled environmental niches of the 100 most common trees in coffee and cocoa systems, we show that the some of the most preferred trees are also among the most vulnerable to climate change. We call for a re-thinking on the design of the current agroforestry schemes, taking into account the vulnerability of the trees species. Farmers have an opportunity to increase the density of underutilised trees already present in most of the current coffee and cocoa systems. Transformation costs and lack of markets for underutilised trees are among the bottlenecks for the adaptation of such crop systems. Modern approaches as phylogenetics and functional traits showed positive prospects to support the selection of species based on crop $\times$ tree interactions. The current advances in selecting coffee and cocoa genotypes to develop new climate-adapted varieties can also provide, together with agroforestry, a new hope to smallholder farmers that are strongly vulnerable to climate change. 

By scaling agricultural experimentation powered with citizen science we developed and validated a method that can generate tailored recommendations for crop variety management. This can significantly reduce the risks of smallholder farmers in managing crop varieties under seasonal changes in climate patterns. The approach was validated with datapoints from thousands of farmer-managed plots in smallholder farms in three continents. The outcomes of this study, however, can be applied to a diverse set of regions (beyond tropical areas) and farming systems, and possibly be applied to large-scale farm systems. We also showed the ability of this method, linked to DNA and environmental data, to support breeding programs to fully track $G \times E \times M$ interactions and select genotypes with local adapted traits, specifically in challenging crop production environments. The analytical workflow that was developed for this research can be employed to provide new insights as new datapoits becomes available in the future. 


# Future research and perspective

There is a series of open questions to explore on how to identify new agroforestry designs that, at the same time, provide benefits to farmers and are resilient to future climates. The increasingly number of datasets being made available by research organisations in open source databases (*e.g.* Dataverse, Zenodo, CGIAR Gardian) may support the meta-analysis of large datasets to infer patterns on crop $\times$ tree interactions to deliver recommendations based on the portfolio theory [@Blandon1985]. New studies on phylogenetics [@Sauvadet2020] and farmers' local knowledge [@Cerdan2012] also offers an excellent opportunity to provide data-driven insights for future agroforestry designs.

Future research on crop variety management would explore the many other dimensions of the *tricot* data. Understanding farmers' planting decisions (based on the recorded planting dates) could provide information on which environmental factors need to be considered to adjust the crop growing calendar for climate adaptation. We also see a potential to employ the citizen science data with crop models targeting challenging crop production environments by, for example, using the new indices for physiological point stress implemented in the package `climatrends`. Incorporating socio-economic data derived from the Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) data [@Hammond2017] could unlock a new factor (S) to the interactions that drive crop variety performance and management decisions, in that way tracking $G \times E \times M \times S$ interactions as they occur in the system. Future research would look for adoption rates of new crop varieties and look for the intertwining of farmers' overall appreciation with other traits (*e.g.* resistance to pests, market value) that are also registered in the *tricot* trials but never explored until now. In the final line of the breeding program, it is also important to consider the consumers' preference and market acceptance on new products, the *tricot* approach could support such assessments and orient breeders and markets on the development and fine tuning of agricultural products for resilient and sustainable food systems.
