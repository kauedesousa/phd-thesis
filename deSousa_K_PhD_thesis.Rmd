# Abstract

Agriculture is a dynamic activity that constantly evolve since its origin. It sustains food and other goods that the global population depends on. Aiming to ensure global food security, the sector has evolved dramatically, especially over the last century with the introduction of high-yielding crops, improved technology, and pathogen resistant and nutrition enriched varieties, to name a few. Still, according to the FAO, the food security issue is constantly present. In 2019, around 26% of the world population experienced either a moderate or severe level of food insecurity. Climate change makes the challenge of food security even more accurate. To cope with climate change and global food insecurity, the whole food system needs to be transformed, including at farm level but also on how food is distributed and what we eat. It is argued that increased agrobiodiversity through farm diversification and varietal selection can help farmers to cope up with the negative effects of climate change while ensuring food security. However, such approaches have been difficult to scale up. One could argue that we often lack information to understand the contexts that drives farmers’ adaptation decisions. In this thesis we developed methods and tools to support farmers and stakeholders in adapting to a changing climate. We compiled evidence and insights from three continents to improve the understanding of the food systems at the farm level, and specifically for smallholders.

# Sammendrag

Landbruk er en dynamisk aktivitet som stadig utvikler seg siden opphavet. Den opprettholder mat og andre varer som verdens befolkning er avhengig av. Sektoren har som mål å sikre global matsikkerhet utviklet seg dramatisk, spesielt i løpet av det siste århundret med introduksjon av høye avlinger, forbedret teknologi og patogene resistente og ernæringsanrikede varianter, for å nevne noen. Fortsatt, ifølge FAO, er matsikkerhetsspørsmålet stadig til stede. I 2019 opplevde rundt 26% av verdensbefolkningen enten et moderat eller alvorlig nivå av matusikkerhet. Klimaendringer gjør utfordringen med matsikkerhet enda mer nøyaktig. For å takle klimaendringer og global matusikkerhet, må hele matsystemet transformeres, inkludert på gårdsnivå, men også på hvordan mat blir distribuert og hva vi spiser. Det argumenteres for at økt agrobiodiversitet gjennom diversifisering av gårdsbruk og sortering av sorter kan hjelpe bønder til å takle de negative effektene av klimaendringer og samtidig sikre matsikkerhet. Slike tilnærminger har imidlertid vært vanskelig å skalere opp. Man kan hevde at vi ofte mangler informasjon for å forstå sammenhenger som driver bøndenes tilpasningsvedtak. I denne oppgaven utviklet vi metoder og verktøy for å støtte bønder og interessenter i å tilpasse seg et klima i endring. Vi samlet bevis og innsikt fra tre kontinenter for å bedre forståelsen av matsystemene på gårdsnivå, og spesielt for småbrukere.

# Introduction

# Objectives

In this project I focussed in provide insights and develop methods to support farmers and stakeholders in adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate, specifically for smallholders, by answering the following questions:

**How does climate awareness influences farmers’ adaptation decisions? (Paper I)**

Climate change increases the risks and uncertainties associated with agriculture, particularly for smallholders [@Altieri2017; @Campbell2016]. The evidence has shown that the adoption of agricultural innovations and climate-adapted practices can help vulnerable farmers to cope with the effects of climate variability and change [@Lipper2014; @Vermeulen2013; @Vermeulen2012]. These practices include farm sustainable intensification, diversification of production, agroforestry, crop variety management and plant breeding. Farmers' awareness and perceptions of climate change are correlated with the adoption of such innovations [@Elum2017; @Niles2016; @Schattman2016; @Singh2017], but no evidence is provided for smallholders in Central America. Paper I [@deSousa2018] targets this knowledge gap. 

**What is the future of current agroforestry combinations in coffee and cocoa production systems? (Paper II)**

Agroforestry, the deliberate and simultaneous management of trees within crop or livestock systems, is considered an important climate-adapted innovation to increase the resilience of agricultural systems [@Nair1993; @Spurgeon1979]. Trees can ameliorate the micro-climate and facilitate the performance of understory crops [@Holmgren2010]. Most perennial crop systems in Central America (e.g. coffee and cocoa) are managed following agroforestry practices [@Beer1998; @Somarriba2013], and have been increasingly encouraged as climate change is projected to affect future crop production [@OvalleRivera2015]. Nevertheless, climate change can also affect the future ecological niches of several tree species [@Holmgren2013; @Lyra2017] and may restrain the prospects of agroforestry as a viable approach for climate adaptation. Paper II [@deSousa2019] assesses the future of the 100 most common tree species found in coffee and cocoa production systems in Central America.

**Can cocoa became a suitable alternative in vulnerable coffee production areas? (Paper III)**

As climate change projections points to a decline in coffee production due to the increasingly climate variability [@OvalleRivera2015; @Bunn2015; @Laderach2017], farmers has developed a taste for cocoa. The drivers of this shift are trends in recent years of increasing coffee production costs and large loses due to pests and diseases (e.g. leaf rust crisis) [@Avelino2015]. Replacing coffee by cocoa has become one of the main strategies for climate change adaptation for producers in low elevation areas [@Laderach2017]. Nevertheless, there is no quantitative assessment of the feasibility of such strategy, starting from considering that cocoa is vulnerable to climate change itself [@Schroth2016]. Paper II [@deSousa2019] also explore this strategy assessing the potential areas where cocoa is a suitable alternative to coffee.


**Can on-farm participatory crop trials generate insights into variety management for climate adaptation? (Paper III)**

Crop improvement increases production and contribute the food and nutrition security [@Hickey2019; @Godfray2010]. Previous studies has shown that is critical that farmers keep a continuous turnover of improved and local-adapted varieties for climate adaptation [@Challinor2016; @Atlin2017]. One constrain, however, in adopting this practice is the cost in investing in seasonal management. Farmers often rely on their local varieties and changing to new ones can increase the risks when the performance of these varieties under local conditions is unknown [@Dawson2008]. Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack the ability to provide such recommendations in marginal production environments across space and time. Paper III [@vanEtten2019] address this issue by exploring a participatory approach to characterise varietal climatic responses allowing for seasonal and geographical extrapolation. 

**Can a data-driven decentralised approach improve the selection of genotypes in challenging crop production environments? (Paper IV)**

To adapt to climate change farmers require accelerated selection of genotypes and production of local-adapted varieties [@Godfray2010; @Eshed2019]. At present, plant breeders use genomic selection to increase selection intensity while reducing the time of the breeding cycle and deriving greater genetic gain [@Hickey2019]. Conventional breeding programs often rely on a centralised scheme aimed at maximizing genetic diversity in the early stages of selection and then identifying superior germplasm on the basis of phenotypic observations made in a limited number of environments [@Heffner2009]. This may result in sub-optimal selection of genotypes targeted to marginal production environments [@Ceccarelli2007]. Decentralised participatory approaches could help breeders in accelerate the selection of genotypes while addressing the $G \times E \times M$ interactions required for climate change adaptation [@Ceccarelli2019; @vanEeuwijk2001; @Tester2010; @vanEtten2019tricot]. Paper IV (de Sousa et al 2020) addresses this issue by comparing a decentralised data-driven approach with a benchmark representing conventional.

# Methods

## Research sites

The studies took place in three different regions, Central America, East Africa and South Asia (Fig. 1). The regions are characterised by its rich plant diversity being *Centre of Origin* and domestication [@Vavilov] of important staples and crops such as wheat, durum wheat, rice, common beans, maize, coffee and cocoa. Smallholder agriculture and livestock production are the main livelihood for the majority of the population living in these regions. Poverty and food insecurity levels in the regions are still among the higher in the world. According to the 2019's report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition [@SOFI2019], in 2018 Central America, East Africa and South Asia had, respectively, a prevalence of severe or moderate food insecurity for 31.5%, 62.7% and 34.3% of their total population.

Field data was collected between 2010 and 2016 as part of a series of Research for Development programs performed across the regions. In Central America, farmer's surveys were conducted in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. A subset of participatory crop trials were conducted in Nicaragua.

$$
P (i \succ j) = \frac{p_i}{p_i + p_j}
$$
where $p_i$ is a positive real-valued score assigned to individual $i$. The comparison $i \succ j$ can be read as "$i$ ranks higher than $j$"
